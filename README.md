## Description

ZenPages is a MERN stack single-page application designed to cater individuals seeking a platform for digital journaling, organization, reflection, and privacy.

The motivation behind this project is to provide users with a space to document their thoughts, feelings, and experiences, while also offering tools for organization and self-reflection.

### Problem Statement

Traditional journaling methods can be cumbersome, vulnerable to physical damage or loss, and lack the convenience of digital tools.
